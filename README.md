# Bank - OOP Project

Overview
This Project is a demonstration of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in Java. 

It showcases the use of interfaces, abstract classes, and inheritance to model banking operations without relying on external frameworks like Spring or REST APIs. The project focuses on core OOP concepts and provides a modular structure for basic banking functionalities.

Key Features-
Object-Oriented Programming: Utilises inheritance, encapsulation, and method overriding.
Interface and Abstract Classes: Demonstrates the use of interfaces and abstract classes for creating a flexible structure.
Custom Banking Methods: Implements methods for managing accounts, loans, and currency exchange.

	Bank Interface
Defines the basic structure for banking operations.

	BankX Abstract Class (Implements Bank)
Provides a partial implementation of the Bank interface and manages account details.

	ATM Abstract Class (Extends BankX)
Adds functionality for currency exchange and loan management.

	Client Class (Extends ATM)
Represents a client of the bank.

Future Enhancements:
Additional functionalities will be developed and added gradually. Future updates may include:

Integration with external libraries or APIs.
Enhanced user interface for better interaction.
Advanced banking features such as investment options, multi-currency support, and transaction history.
